# Installation

## Overview
Polly is written in Go, so there are typically no dependencies that must be installed alongside its single binary file. The `curl` utility can be used to perform a simple manual installation. You also have the opportunity to perform install steps individually. Following an install, [configuration](./config.md) must take place before use.

---

## Simple curl-bash install

The following command will install the most recent, stable build of Polly to:
` /usr/bin/polly`.

```shell
sudo curl -sSL https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/polly/install | sh -s stable
```

You may switch out the `stable` parameter for `staged` or `unstable` to get the
latest of those releases.

## Installing a specific pre-built binary version
There are a handful of necessary manual steps to properly install Polly
from pre-built binaries.

1. Download the proper binary. There are also pre-built binaries available for
the various release types.

    Version  | Description
    ---------|------------
    [Unstable](https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/polly/unstable/latest/) | The most up-to-date, bleeding-edge, and often unstable Polly binaries.
    [Staged](https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/polly/stable/latest/) | The release candidates for Polly binaries.
    [Stable](https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/polly/stable/latest/) | The most up-to-date, stable Polly binaries.


2. Uncompress and move the binary to the proper location. `/usr/bin`
is the preferred normal location, but this path is not required.

## Build and install from source

`Polly` is also fairly simple to build from source:

### Option 1: Build using a Docker container

```shell
SRC=$(mktemp -d 2> /dev/null || mktemp -d -t polly 2> /dev/null) && cd $SRC && docker run --rm -it -e GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 -v $SRC:/usr/src/polly -w /usr/src/polly golang:1.6.1 bash -c "git clone https://github.com/emccode/polly.git -b master . && make build-all‚Äù
```

### Option 2: Conventional build from source

If you'd prefer to not use `Docker` to build `Polly,` [Install go 1.6.1](https://golang.org/doc/install) or later and set the GOPATH environment variable.

Also set the environment variable GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT:

```shell
export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1
```

#### Clone the polly repo

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/emccode
git clone https://github.com/emccode/polly.git
```

##### Change directories

`cd polly`

##### Build polly

`make build-all`

### Build artifacts

After either of the above methods for building `polly` there should be a `.bin` directory in the current directory, and inside `.bin` will be binaries for Linux-i386, Linux-x86-64, and Darwin-x86-64.

```shell
$ ls .bin/*/polly
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root 14M Sep 17 10:36 .bin/Darwin-x86_64/polly*
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root 12M Sep 17 10:36 .bin/Linux-i386/polly*
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root 14M Sep 17 10:36 .bin/Linux-x86_64/polly*
```

Copy the binary to `/usr/bin`.
